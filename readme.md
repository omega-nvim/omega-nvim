# Omega the second
Rewrite of omega-nvim neovim config (max397574/omega-nvim)
This config should be usable as is

You can place your own plugins or disable plugins inside the `lua/omega/custom` folder.

Atm this only has onedark colorscheme and you can't also install plugins for other ones because a specific style of themes is needed
